# KamodofyPlasmaPy
kamodo wrapper for the PlasmaPy library

This wrapper enables manipulation of a large portion of the PlasmaPy library in Kamodo.

You must have kamodo, plasmapy, and astropy installed into your environment for this to work. KamodofyPlasmaPy assumes that Kamodo is installed in the same directory as the KamodofyPlasmaPy.py file. Change the Kamodo import statement to reflect the location of your kamodo installation. An example notebook is included, called KPP_Demo.
